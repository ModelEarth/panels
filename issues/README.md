# Issues

We need a Microsoft expert to help resolve the following.

1. Granting permission to iFrames is not working.

2. Axios news embed is not appearing.

3. Pulling related user data is not working.

Microsoft Sharepoint can be a major inhibitor in implementing improvements to workflow.  
Documentation of ongoing Sharepoint issues:

## iFrame embed issue

Browse to the root of your site collection:
https://[youraccount].sharepoint.com/SitePages/
(If the black bar does not appear on the top, hit refresh)

Go to Settings icon > Site information > View all site Settings

The above page is blank. 
(Just the blue top and bottom appear, with the word "Intranet")

When it works, adding adding websites to the approved list has no effect.


## Axios news embed issue

Our organization is unable to embed the Axios news service as a Sharepoint webpart. (More documentation to be added.)


## Pulling related user data

Microsoft API's do not include related user content. (More documentation to be added.)

We're developing simultaneously for Microsoft and the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to allow organizations to gracefully migrate to the most cost effective Customer Relation Management (CRM) processes.
