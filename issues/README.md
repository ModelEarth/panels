# Improving Microsoft with Discord API

We're developing simultaneously for Microsoft and the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to allow organizations to choose the most cost effective Customer Relation Management (CRM) processes.

Simultaneous development with multiple APIs allows us to do UX design when developers do not have access to the Microsoft sandbox.

## iFrame embed issue

Granting permission to iFrames seemed not to work for all admins

Make sure you start from the SitePages root:

https://[youraccount].sharepoint.com/SitePages/
(If the black bar does not appear on the top, hit refresh)

Go to Settings icon > Site information > View all site Settings

The above page is blank for some administrators. 
(Just the blue top and bottom appear, with the word "Intranet")
